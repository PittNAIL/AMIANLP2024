        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in everyday life has rapidly 
            progressed over the past decades. This progress has been enabled by the availability 
            of tools, large language models (LLMs), and resources that could be shared, reused, and 
            fine-tuned to support users’ projects and collaborations. Today, recently evolved 
            generative AI is being integrated into general search and 
            workplace productivity tools. Applying NLP to the textual content of patient 
            electronic health records (i.e., clinical text) is constrained by strict patient 
            privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations. These domain-specific peculiarities 
            for access and sharing of resources (e.g., annotated text corpora) and 
            tools (e.g., trained machine learning algorithms) require creative solutions. 
            Despite these privacy restrictions, many research teams have succeeded in developing 
            novel biomedical and clinical NLP methods, creating and then sharing resources 
            based on clinical text in a thoughtful and sustainable manner. Despite the legal 
            specifics surrounding patient data, NLP-based technologies have permeated clinical 
            and translational research. Our general objective with this pre-symposium is (1) to 
            provide a platform for the next generation of biomedical NLP scientists to get focused 
            feedback on their in-progress graduate work from a panel of senior academicians, 
            (2) to provide career advice and resources for career development to address a need 
            identified at our last AMIA NLP WG business meeting due to rapid marketplace changes, 
            (3) to demonstrate and train the latest achievements, resources, and tools within 
            the biomedical and clinical NLP community along with their reusability, portability, 
            and interoperability with a particular focus on prompt engineering, 
            (4) provide a forum for people to quickly present their work, providing awareness 
            and opportunities for networking and collaboration within the AMIA NLP community, 
            and (5) to discuss ethical issues related to the emerging NLP technologies, 
            especially as they relate to the healthcare industry (and adjunct industries).</p> 
        <br> <br>
        <p>The pre-symposium will be divided into four sessions. 
            Session 1 is a graduate student consortium (i.e., open to both Doctoral candidates and Master’s level students), 
            where students can present their work and get feedback from experienced researchers in the field. 
            Session 2 is a career panel aimed at providing resources for career growth to meet the rapidly changing field/marketplace. 
            Session 3 is a state-of-the-art biomedical and clinical NLP session consisting of a series of short lightning talks by NLP community members. 
            Session 4 will be an interactive panel session on AI ethics related to NLP, especially the new generative AI models such as GPT-4. 
            We will discuss the opportunities, challenges, and approaches to tackling ethical challenges as a working group and a community.</p>

            2) discuss specific questions about study design, algorithm development, or evaluation plan;<br>
            3) receive constructive feedback and suggestions about their dissertation work; and<br>
            4) establish possible collaborations.<br><br>
            Four selected students will each have 15 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes 
            for discussion with a panel of well-established experts and researchers in 
            biomedical and clinical NLP. The session Chair will be Dr. Joseph Plasek from the Mass General Brigham.</p>
